# Title: Finding Seats in Library

## Team Member(s):
Jialu Wang, Qi Qi

# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose:
During final month, it is difficult to get a seat in the library.

We want to find how long people will wait until they find a seat in a library. 

We observe two types of study units in a library:

1. individual student (1)
2. study group (2-6)

We observe three types of room:
1. independent study seat (1)
2. study desk (6)
3. study room (6)

### Hypothesis before running the simulation:
1. individual will only seat at study seats/study desk not taken by group
2. group will only seat at study room/study desk with available rest seats
3. average incoming study unit rate is 5 min/unit

### Simulation's variables of uncertainty
size of incoming study unit

stay time of existing study unit
